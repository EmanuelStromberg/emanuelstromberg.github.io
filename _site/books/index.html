Caro</strong> A fantastic book about a power hungry man who amassed a lot of it during his lifetime. Let me paint a picture. Elected officials worked for him when it should had been the other way around. On paper they were his bosses but that wasn’t true in practice. He controlled them. His influence on New York City was massive and can be seen to this day. Moses was a fascinating man and Caro brings him to life.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy-ebook/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1609320444&amp;sr=8-1">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport</strong> Everybody should read this book. As our lives become more digital, the ideas it contains and the value it gives will sky rocket. This book isn’t a case against technology, Newport is a computer scientist after all, rather it brings up an important discussion about making active choices in choosing which technology we interact with. That might sound trivial but it’s a lot more profound the more you think about it. This book contains ideas which can help you trim your digital life and in the processes ease anxiety caused by our hyperconnected lives.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1609320713&amp;sr=8-1">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport</strong> Main idea is this: focus on deep rather than shallow tasks. Newport believes that the ability to focus is becoming more rare and because of that also more valuable. Deep work isn’t only for work. You can use and adapt the ideas towards your free time also. That’s what I’ve done. I like to write, I would like to become better at it and that’s were Deep Work comes into use for me.</p>

Frankl describes how his life was in the Nazi concentraion camps. It’s an intense and emotional read. Man’s Search For Meaning is for everyone who would want to live a meaningful life. Frankl writes about three sources that brings meaning to our lives: doing significant work, selfless love, and showing courage in difficult times. It changed my life, maybe it will change yours too.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://mises.org/library/anatomy-state">Anatomy of the State</a> by Murray Rothbard</strong> Most people will find this book and the ideas it contains a bit extreme. Thankfully you don’t have to agree with everything you read. In this work Rothbard discusses what the state is, what it is not and how it survives. I’ll give you a little preview: “the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime. . . . It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or of alien”. If nothing else, it’s a thought-provoking book, if your able to read it without throwing it away in a fit of rage that is.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Liberty-Murray-N-Rothbard-dp-0814775594/dp/0814775594/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=">The Ethics of Liberty</a> by Murry Rothbard</strong> A classic text on libertarian issues. Rothbard writes a defense for free market anarcishm. He builds his defense on objective values and natural rights. From Rothbards point of view, only self-ownership, the non-aggression principle and property rights can lay the foundation for a truly free society. While I didn’t agree with everything, it made me think, which is all I can ask for from a book.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Political-Authority-Examination-Coerce/dp/1137281650/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FBJCXZEU0GTC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+problem+with+political&amp;qid=1609320356&amp;sprefix=neil+gai%2Caps%2C474&amp;sr=8-1">The Problem with Political Authority</a> by Micheal Huemer</strong> This book is a systematic criticism of political authority. In part 1 of the book Huemer discusses if the states has a right (power) to create duties and in part 2 of the book he discusses if a state has the right to coerce it’s citizens. Ideas that many of us takes for granted, such as the social contract, is discussed in a way I hadn’t heard before. I think most people would disagree with the ideas and conclusions of the book. Not because they are weak (Huemer makes strong case), rather because they are extreme and different. That is also why you should read it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Economics-Politics-Perspectives-Democratic-ebook/dp/B07BYL6ZJ6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QY55HZL0CDLE&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=hans+herman+hoppe&amp;qid=1609320188&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=hans+her%2Cdigital-text%2C231&amp;sr=1-1">Democracy: The God That Failed</a> by Hans-Herman Hoppe</strong> Mind-blowing. Hoppe is radical in his belifes and writing. In this work he systimaticlly works through the historic transformation when the West went from monarchy to democracy. From there, it’s a wild ride. If you read this book (you should) be prepared to be offended. His views on for example culture and immigration are not mainstream. I like to be chanllenged, and this book will call into question many things you beleive.</p>
